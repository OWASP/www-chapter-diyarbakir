### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the OWASP Diyarbakir Chapter!

The OWASP Diyarbakir Chapter is an open and inclusive community dedicated to promoting awareness, education, and collaboration around software security in Southeastern Turkey.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, student, or cybersecurity enthusiast â€” you're welcome here. Our mission is to build a strong local ecosystem where people can learn, share, and grow together through meetups, workshops, CTFs, and open-source contributions.

We are currently building our core team and planning our first events. If you would like to join us, give a talk, or help organize local activities, please reach out â€” weâ€™d love to hear from you!

Stay tuned for upcoming announcements!

â€” OWASP Diyarbakir Team
